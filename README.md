### Application's Features are plitted into 3 parts: User, LoanAmount, and Repayments
1. User:
    - Register
    - Login
    - Admin role: Approve Loan Amount

2. LoanAmount
    - Create LoanAmount:
        - When a LoanAmount is created the payments will be created automatically base on required_amount and loan_term. which the repayment amount and date are calculated to match the application's requirement.
    - List LoanAmounts
    - Show a specific LoanAmount
    - Update a specific LoanAmount
        - When a LoanAmount is updated the number of payments will be adjust automatically base on the loan_term and the repayment amount for each term will be recalculated to match the application's requirement.

3. Repayment

    - Show a specific Repayment
